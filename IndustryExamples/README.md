# Explanation
This folder has some completed python files with different approaches to the MNIST dataset. 
I do recommend running these files just to see how they output. 

## PyTorch.py
This is the basic MNIST example being solved by PyTorch. 

## PyTorch_RNN.py
This is the recurrent neural network approached, designed by PyTorch.
