# Explanation
This folder has some completed python files with different approaches to the MNIST dataset. 
I do recommend running these files just to see how they output. 

## CNN.py
This is the basic MNIST example being solved by PyTorch. 

## RNN.py
This is the recurrent neural network approached, designed by PyTorch. 

## Extras
To use the trained model, you can download an image off of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderyyy/mnist-png). And run  `/Extras/RunningModels.py` file with the correct file addresses.
